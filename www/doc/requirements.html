    <h1>Download Package Requirements</h1>

    <i>This is a DRAFT</i>

    <h3>I. Introduction</h3>

    <p> OpenACS 4.x has a file storage module, so an obvious question is:
    "Why do we need a seperate download module?"  The download module
    is targeted at a different usage pattern and interface.  The
    intent of the download module is to provide an online repository
    for the public (or pseudo-public) distribution of infrequently
    modified files.  The ACS 3.4 download module, used at
    http://www.arsdigita.com/download for distribution of software
    provided by ArsDigita, and the acs-repository, used at
    http://www.arsdigita.com/acs-repository for distribution of ACS
    packages, are the prime examples of this usage pattern.  While
    the file-storage module could be used for this purpose, it would
    be an akward fit.  Additionally, we would like to track who has
    downloaded the file and have the ability to spam or charge those
    users as appropriate.

    <h3>II. Vision Statement</h3>

    <p>
    There are thousands of independent developers all over the world
    writing their own OpenACS packages.  Without a canonical distribution
    point finding the packages you need becomes a formidable task,
    forcing developers to duplicating each others efforts.  The
    download module allows us to setup a package repository service
    for users to upload their own packages and download contributed
    packages in order to facilitate true development collaboration.

    </p>

    <h3>III. System/Application Overview</h3>
    
    <p>
    The OpenACS download package provides an application for managing file
    distribution.
    </p>

    <p>
    The package consists of the following components:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>A data model for storing files.
    <li>A data model for storing meta-information about files.
    <li>A data model for storing information about who has downloaded files.
    <li>A user interface for displaying available files.
    <li>A user interface for downloading files.
    <li>A user interface for uploading files.
    <li>A user interface for administering files.
    </ul>

    <h3>IV. Use-cases and User Scenarios</h3>

    The download package is intended to support two user roles:
    <ol>
      <li>User (downloading and contributing)
      <li>Administrator
    </ol>

    Joe Contributer (currently working for <i>Joe.com</i>) writes a piece
    of software used to do knowledge management (KM) for the ACS.  He
    packages his code using the <a
    href=/doc/packages>APM</a>.  Joe
    feels that others could gain from using his new package so he uploads
    it to the OpenACS Package Repository.  Since it is in APM format, in
    one step a package, version, vendor, owner and description data are
    all uploaded (extracted from the .info file).

    <p>

    Jane Admin who installed and configured the download package chose
    to not allow users to download versions pending approval.  That forces
    her to download Joe's package from the admin pages and install it.
    She notices that it isn't malicious in any way and doesn't harm her
    OpenACS installation so she approves it to go live on her package
    repository.  Joe is informed via email that his package was approved
    (because Jane set this configuration parameter).

    <p>

    Don Downloader is scanning through the most recently uploaded APMs on
    a package repository and finds Joe's KM package.  He notices that
    many other users have downloaded the package and have made comments
    praising the package as well as <i>Joe.com</i>.  Since Ben is a
    follower by heart, he decides to download the package as well and
    install it on his system.  (Ben's crafty friend Alyssa later informs
    Ben that he could have just had the APM install directly from the
    repository url).

    <p>

    Benny Beancounter loves to learn about who's downloading files from
    his site and what reasons they give for downloads.  On a frequent basis,
    Benny visits the download packages admin pages and views a report of
    how many downloads occured for each file.  He then drills down on a
    particular file and views a list of the users who downloaded the file
    and their specified reason for downloading.

    <h3>VI.A Requirements: Datamodel</h3>

    <p><strong>10.0 Versioned File Storage</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    OpenACS Download must provide versioned file storage.
    </p>

    <p><strong>20.0 User Tracking</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    OpenACS Download must store information about which users have downloaded which files (including versions).
    </p>

    <p><strong>20.0 Package Based Meta Information</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    OpenACS Download must be able to store arbitrary meta information on a per package basis.
    i.e. All files provided by this instance of the package require the fields x, y and z.
    </p>

    <h3>VI.B Requirements: Users Interface</h3>

    The requirement of the user interface is to enable the user to access
    package versions in the repository and upload his own packages and
    versions.

    <p>
   <strong>100.0 Define a Package</strong> (must be logged in)
   <p>
   <blockquote>
   <strong>100.1</strong>
   The user must be able to create a repository package by specifying all the necessary information:

   <ul>
     <li>package key (unique)
     <li>package name
     <li>package url (unique)
     <li>owner information
     <li>vendor information (optional)
     <li>Description
     <li>Description Format
     <li>package type
     <li>package category (optional)
   </ul>
   
   <p> 
   <strong>100.2</strong>
   If the user fails to provide the required information the package
   cannot be created.
   
   <p>
   <strong>100.3</strong>
   If the tries to add a package with overlapping values in any unique
   field the package cannot be created.
   
   <p> 
   <strong>100.4</strong>
   All the package information should be edit-able after package
   creation.
   
   </blockquote>

   <p>
   <strong>110.0 Manage Package Permissions</strong> (must be logged in)
   
   <p>
   <blockquote>
   <strong>110.1</strong>
   The user may grant or revoke write and administer privileges on
   any package which he/she has administer privileges.
   
   <p>
   <strong>110.2</strong>
   The user who creates a package starts with write and administer
   privileges.
   
   </blockquote>
   <p>
   <strong>120.0 Upload Versions</strong> (must be logged in)
   <p>
   <blockquote>   
   <strong>120.1</strong>
   The user must be able to upload versions of a package to the
   repository.  These versions contain the actual package content in
   a tarball (gzipped tar archive).  Along with these versions come
   their own meta-data:
   <ul>
     <li>version number (like 1.1 or 1.2.3d4)
     <li>version url (unique)
     <li>Description
     <li>Description Format
   </ul>

   <p>
   <strong>120.2</strong>
    If the user fails to provide the required information the version
    cannot be created.

   <p>
   <strong>120.3</strong>
   If the user tries to add a version with overlapping values in any
   unique field the package cannot be created.

   <p>
   <strong>120.4</strong>
   If the user tries to upload a version which already resides in the
   repository the version cannot be created.

   <p>
   <strong>120.5</strong>
   If the user will not be able to attempt to upload versions into
   packages which he does not have write permission on.

   </blockquote>   
   <p>
   
   <strong>130.0 APM Auto-load</strong> (must be logged in)

   <p>
   <blockquote>   
   <strong>130.1</strong>
   When a user is uploading an APM all package and version information
   must be automatically entered (without additional user
   prompting).

   <p>
   <strong>130.2</strong>
   If it is the first version of a package all package information
   must be added to the repository as well as version data.

   <p>
   <strong>130.3</strong>
   If the package already exists then all package information
   conflicts must be reported to the user.

   </blockquote>   
   <p>
   <strong>140.0 Package Downloading</strong><br>
   Users must be able to access packages once they are live on the
   site.

   <p>
   <blockquote>   
   <strong>140.1</strong>
   Users must be able to view the package meta-data without
   downloading the package.

   <p>
   <strong>140.2</strong>
   Users must be able to download the actual package data.

   </blockquote>   
   <p>

   <strong>150.0 User commenting</strong><br>
   <p>
   A logged in user must be able to comment on vendors, packages, and versions.


   <h3>VI.C Requirements: Administrator's Interface</h3>

   The requirement of the administrator's interface is to enable
   administrators to approve or reject package versions as they are
   uploaded by users.  Naturally any site administrator would have
   rights on all the packages in the repository

   <strong>200.0 Approval Parameters </strong>

   <blockquote>   
   <p>
   <strong>200.1</strong>
   Administrators must be able to set whether or not packages pending
   approval are accessible to users.

   <p>
   <strong>200.2</strong>
   Administrators must be able to set whether or not users are
   notified when their uploaded packages are approved or rejected.
   </blockquote>   
   <p>
   <strong>210.0 Version Approval </strong>
   <p>
   The administrator should be able to approve or reject any submitted
   package version, and enter a comment as to why the version was
   rejected or approved.
